## JSON editor

This is a simple and very basic JSON editor. It was created by me to test my abilities with JSON data processing and file uploading, as well as features like "drag-n-drop".
This app has few options - you can create a new file to put your data in, or upload an existing file and edit it. You can also delete data from it by pressing a corresponding icon.
You can save your changes and the app will ask you to download a file with new changes. The app does not have an automatic saving(yet), so it is advised to save often.

* ! This is not a final version of the app, so more QoL features like data validation will be added soon. *
